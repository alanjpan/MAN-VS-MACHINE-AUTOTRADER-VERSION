Desription: MAN VS MACHINE: AUTOTRADER VERSION is usually not the role playing 
game any one would want to play. This game simulates real-life situations that 
happen every day on trading floors. You are a trader starting with $10. The
autotrader starts with $100 and never misses a good deal. The rules are simple:
BUY and SELL and you bankrupt the autotrader or the autotrader takes your innings. 
Like the real world, the more $wealth you amassed, the easier it is to bankrupt 
others. The only way to bankrupt the AUTOTRADER in this game is by taking over 
the market through amassing $wealth in the market.
